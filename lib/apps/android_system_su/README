This is a clone of the CyanogenMod su binary repository. It was changed so that
every app will be granted root permission without question.

To compile the binary, the following steps are required (assuming that the
android-source trunk is available in /android-source):

    source /android-source/envsetup.sh
    TOP=/android-source/
    mm -B

The new ARM binary will be available in:

    /android-source/out/target/product/generic/system/xbin/su


To install the new su binary:

    adb shell mount -o rw,remount /system /system
    adb push /android-source/out/target/product/generic/system/xbin/su /system/xbin/su
    adb shell chmod 6755 /system/xbin/su
    adb shell mount -o ro,remount /system /system

Note that the scripts of this platform expect a su binary in the current
directory. If you made changes to the sources in this directory, make sure you
copy the fresh binary in here before generating a new image
(build-avd-gapps.sh) or using the install_su() command via emudroid.py.

    cp /android-source/out/target/produc/generic/system/xbin/su .


The SU app in lib/apps/SU demonstrates how you can now execute commands as
root.

Note that an important difference between the official Android su binary and
the CyanogenMod su binary is the lack of a -c option in the Android one.







This is the su binary for Superuser on Android.

Any app that requires root access must call this binary in order to be given root access.

Branches for this repo support the following Android versions:

 - legacy
   - cupcake
   - donut

 - master
   - eclair
   - froyo
   - gingerbread
   - honeycomb*

Branches marked with '-dev' are in work and should probably not be used. I will push to those channels as I develop new versions so they may be broken from time to time.

* I have yet to personally test superuser on any honeycomb devices, therefore I cannot guarantee it's compatibility
